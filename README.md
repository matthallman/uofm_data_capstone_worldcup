# Group 4 Capstone Project Proposal

#### Proposal Requirements:

Topic Intro: We want to use previous World Cup data along with our own power metrics to try and make a mock World Cup bracket. We will use machine learning to train the models and predict what the results of the group stage will be, then the elimination rounds.

Inspiration: Most of us are sports fans and if not then we are all interested in current events happening around the world. The FIFA World Cup begins this Fall in Qatar and many fans will be tuning in. In 2018 it was estimated that a combined 3.57 billion viewers watched the World Cup which is almost half the worldâ€™s population. Throughout the bootcamp we have seen examples of how data science can be applied to sports and we thought we would do something similar. There is a ton of historical data that we can use to build our machine learning model, in hopes to predict certain outcomes within the World Cup.
